<h2>r-google-analytics</h2>
This is a fork of the RGoogleAnalytics package from http://code.google.com/p/r-google-analytics/. All credit is due to those authors: Michael Pearmain, Nicolas Remy, Nick Mihailovski

This fork has had several changes made to be more user friendly, including:
* Handle spaces in query definition
* Added support for storing Google username and password on the filesystem (in home directory/.rGooogleAnalytics_creds). This is not particularly secure, but better than storing in a script or plaintext file on the filesystem.
